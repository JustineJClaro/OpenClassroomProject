          <h3>Academics</h3>
          <p>These are what I did in my academics throughout High School. I've earned Academic Honors, CTE Honors, Seal of Biliteracy, and Valedictorian in the class of 2025. I've been recognized and was successful in many projects that helps the community. Aside from recognitions, I've joined many clubs and took part in many of their activities. I've even took a huge step and joined a few Honor Societies to be a part of something bigger and make a change. I was also an ambassador for the pathway of Cybersecurity in the Academy of Industrial and Engineering Technology at Waipahu High School. As an ambassador, I represent my pathway and take part in activities such as recruiting new students to join our academy and our pathway.</p>

          <h3>Japanese Club</h3>
          <p>Japanese club was a place where students were able to hang out and share their love for Japanese culture. Every club activity we have is about Japan. We did presentations about Japanese culture, play Japanese games, watch anime, and have field trips. It's a very friendly place where everyone can hang out. Whenever we step into the clubroom, the members are bursting with excitement. Although meetings are short, it's alwas a pleasure to be inside that clubroom with many amazing people. For homecoming in Waipahu High School, Japanese club takes part in the parade.</p>

            <p>I was a member of the National Japanese Language Honor Society. The National Japanese Language Honor Society is an organization for students who excel in their Japanese language class. In this organization, we are doing frequent activities at school or somewhere else on Oahu that's Japanese related. We're able to give a tours to Japanese exhcange students, have field trips, take care of anything Japanese related at Waipahu High School, and even have the opportunity to go to Japan. This organization is similar to Japanese club, but our activities are at a much larger scale and challnges us to hone our Japanese speaking skills by speaking to Japanese speakers.</p>

This organiztaion emphasizes leadership and service, which we do a lot of them in NTHS. As an organization, the rules are very strict and it is recommended to take part in most of the activities.</p>

As an ambassador, I am a student who represents my pathway and my academy. My job is to go to the ambassador meetings and take part in activities when the school needs me. Sometimes, the school will choose the ambassadors to take a tour of their academy as they are people who also know a lot about them. It is also our job to recruit newcommers from Waipahu Intermediate schools to join our pathway and our academy by showcasing what we're able to do.</p>

During freshman and sophomore year, I've been recognized for being an outstanding student in GLO #4: Quality producer, IT foundations and Cybersecurity Level One. I'd say that the most impactful recognitions I've had were in sophomore year. Some examples would be winning a $5,000 scholarship in Launchpad for being a leader, work ethic, and cooperation. I've even gave a speech in behalf of the current generation of Waipahu High school in the 85th Anniversary.</p>

Lastly, ENGLISH100 was a beginner college course in english to test our literacy skills in English.
