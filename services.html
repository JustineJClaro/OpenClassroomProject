                <h3>Service Activites</h3>
                <p>Throughout my entire High School career, I've done service activities for lots of my extracurricular activities. I always needed to do my part in the community which is why I pushed myself to joining clubs, organizations, and projects that allow me to help the community. I've done service activities mostly in the Honor Societies I've joined and they have alawys been fun to do. Some other activities I did was out of school and were very impactful. For example, I've done a service activity for the Filipino Community Center to help their business which also had a scholarship as a reward. Once I've won a huge scholarship, it was a big moment for me as I've worked really hard and made me truly see that hard work truly pays off. This is only the beginning of the journey for me as I have a whole life to do my part.</p>

                    <h3>NTHS Services</h3>
                    <p>These are some of the service activites I did for the National Technical Honor Society. We were always ready to help and had fun doing them. We did things like helping with the Great Aloha Run of 2024 and Rally for Ren. During my beginning time in NTHS, I first did the Maui Donations for the victims of the Lahaina fire. It was an urgent matter as the fire took up a huge part of Maui. Besides this, I felt doing the service activity for Rally for Ren was very impactful as we work our hardest to raise money for a boy who unfortunately passed away. We've also done other services for Waipahu High school such as campus beautification where we cleaned up the school and make it look beautiful.</p>

                    <h3>NJLHS Services</h3>
                    <p>NJLHS Services are usually at school where we're cleaning stuff up, especially the Japanese Rock garden, the Culinary Garden, and the Library. Although this is only one photo, this is what we usually do and it's very repetitive. Sometimes though, we're in charge of building the Japanese things that our Sensei (Advisor) is in charge of. Services are about 4 hours every time we are called by Sensei. It's fun to do something and see that our Japanese structures are very well maintained. After the services, we go back to our Sensei's classroom and play video games, watch anime, and have a small potluck.</p>

                    <h3>Launchpad</h3>
                    <p>Launchpad I felt was the most impactful service I've ever done. What we basically did was to help the Filipino Community Center with reducing their catering setup time and to clean the facility. This took very long and took a lot of planning to be succesful. This service took about 57 hours. Despite the long hours, we were extremely successful as our objective made the Filipino Community Center's system be 75% more effieient. After completing the service, I was awarded with a $5,000 scholarship as I showed the best work ethic, cooperation, and leadership. I've never knew I could do something really amazing until the time I took part in Launchpad.</p>
